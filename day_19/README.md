# Day 19: Monster Messages

Absolutely 100% cheated on this one. My original thought was to write some sort of top-down or bottom-up parser (shift reduce?). I spent several days reading up on them, but, to be honest, I lost all interest. Too much work, time, and study. I eventually scoured reddit looking for something and found [this](https://github.com/stevotvr/adventofcode2020/blob/main/aoc2020/src/com/stevotvr/aoc2020/Day19.java). I modified it to suit my needs, got the stars, and moved on.

Part 2 of [this](https://github.com/mebeim/aoc/blob/master/2020/README.md#day-19---monster-messages) (Real solution) also looks interesting .

At some point I'd like to dig into the parsing a bit deeper, when I'm more inspired and have more patience. When that day comes, I will revisit this.
